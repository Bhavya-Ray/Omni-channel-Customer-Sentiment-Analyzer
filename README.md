## 🧠 Omni-channel Customer Sentiment Analyzer

Analyze and compare customer sentiment across platforms like **Amazon** and **Twitter** using both **VADER (lexicon-based)** and **BERT (transformer-based)** sentiment models.

---

### 📂 Dataset Description

* **Amazon Reviews** and **Tweets** are collected, preprocessed, and analyzed.
* Columns include: `text`, `clean_text`, `vader_sentiment`, `bert_sentiment`, timestamps, etc.

---

### 🧼 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

**Purpose:**
To normalize text data from both platforms (Amazon and Twitter) for sentiment analysis.

**Key steps:**

* Lowercasing
* Removing URLs, punctuation, mentions, stopwords, etc.
* Tokenization and lemmatization (if applied)

> 🔍 This ensures consistent inputs for both VADER and BERT models.

---

### 📊 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

**Purpose:**
Understand data distribution, platform usage, and sentiment trends.

**Graphs & Meaning:**

* 📌 **Bar plot of sentiment counts (VADER)** – shows the proportion of `positive`, `neutral`, and `negative` sentiments detected by VADER.
* 📌 **Tweet vs Amazon sentiment comparison** – compares sentiment distributions across both platforms.

---

### 🧪 3. Sentiment Analysis

#### 🔹 VADER Sentiment

* **Why?** VADER is fast and good for short, social-text-based content like tweets.
* **Output:** A `vader_sentiment` column with `positive`, `neutral`, or `negative`.

#### 🔹 BERT-based Sentiment (DistilBERT)

* **Why?** BERT captures context better, useful for product reviews or nuanced opinions.
* **Output:** A `bert_sentiment` column generated by `distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english`.

### 🔄 4. BERT vs VADER Sentiment Comparison

**Graph & Meaning:**

* 📌 **Countplot of BERT sentiment vs VADER sentiment**

  > Helps you identify disagreement cases between lexicon and transformer models.

Example insight:

> VADER might classify sarcasm as positive, while BERT catches the real tone as negative.

---

### ⏱ 5. Time-based Sentiment Trends (if applied)

**Graph & Meaning:**

* 📈 Line plot or time series showing sentiment trend over time

  > Useful for understanding how sentiment evolves (e.g., before/after a product launch or event).

---

### 🗣 6. Topic Modeling with LDA (if done)

**Purpose:**
To identify underlying themes or topics in customer feedback.

**Graph & Meaning:**

* 📌 **Top words per topic (LDA bar charts or word clouds)**

  > Shows what customers talk about the most (e.g., price, delivery, quality)

---

### 🧠 7. N-gram Analysis

**Purpose:**
To analyze frequently used phrases (bigrams/trigrams).

**Graph & Meaning:**

* 📌 **Bar chart of top bigrams**

  > Helps surface common themes, e.g., `"poor quality"`, `"fast delivery"`

---

### ✅ Conclusion

* Combining **rule-based (VADER)** and **ML-based (BERT)** sentiment models gives richer insight.
* BERT performs better in complex text (like Amazon reviews).
* Visual comparisons help businesses choose the right model for their use case.
